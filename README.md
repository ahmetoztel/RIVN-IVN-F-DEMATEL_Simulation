# RIVN-DEMATEL vs IVN & Fuzzy DEMATEL â€“ Simulation Comparison

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simulation-based comparative analysis between three decision-making methodologies:

- **Rough Interval-Valued Neutrosophic DEMATEL (RIVN-DEMATEL)** â€“ the proposed method,
- **Interval-Valued Neutrosophic DEMATEL (IVN-DEMATEL)**,
- **Triangular Fuzzy DEMATEL (F-DEMATEL)**.

The simulation aims to evaluate the **reliability** and **consistency** of the proposed RIVN-DEMATEL method by comparing its results to the other two established techniques using correlation-based statistical metrics.

## Features

- Generates random expert evaluations using a discrete linguistic scale (0 to 4)
- Applies all three DEMATEL methods under the same simulated conditions
- Computes:
  - Spearman correlation for **D+R (Prominence)** and **Dâˆ’R (Relation)**
  - Pearson correlation for **T matrices**
- Outputs results as:
  - **Boxplot visualizations**
  - **Excel summary files** with mean and standard deviation values for each metric

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `tqdm`

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Run the main script and enter the number of simulation iterations:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle

Academic Context
This simulation was conducted as part of a research study aiming to validate the proposed RIVN-DEMATEL method in comparison with conventional IVN and fuzzy-based DEMATEL techniques. The methodology and analysis were designed for academic use and reproducibility.
